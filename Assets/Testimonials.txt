1. This morning my husband picked up the cake you made for our daughter. When he
came home the 1st thing he said to me was “It’s phenomenal!”. Which is a bit
out of his character. When I saw it I was amazed! The cake was beautiful! Our
daughter LOVED it. She had given us a few ideas of the cake she wanted but
we told her she had to wait to see what we got her at her party.
The guests actually gasped when they saw it. They thought it was gorgeous.
But not only did it look wonderful it tasted great too.
We wanted to tell you what a wonderful cake you made for a special day for
our daughter.
Thank you so much!
